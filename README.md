# Leaflet-Challenge

## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 

### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
  - Visualize an earthquake dataset. Use USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site and choose a dataset to visualize.
  - Pull in the data for the visualization of earthquake data in JSON format
  - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  - Create a legend and popups to provide additional information about the earthquake with its associated marker.

### Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)
Illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Pull in this dataset and visualize it alongside your original data
  - Plot the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes.
  - Add other base maps to choose from.
  - Put each dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
  - Add layer controls to your map.
